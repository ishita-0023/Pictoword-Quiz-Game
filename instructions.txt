How to Play:
1. When you begin a puzzle, the game presents you with two
   pictures. These pictures can be of nearly any person,
   place or thing.
2. Each level will display 4 options out of which only one 
   will be CORRECT . 
3. If you select the right option your score will be increased
   and next logo will be displayed. 
4. If you select the wrong option you would lose. You have
   only one life. 
          So play well !!
